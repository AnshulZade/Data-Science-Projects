# Project Title: Delivery Time Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Introduction
This project aims to predict the delivery time for food orders using a Decision Tree algorithm. Factors such as delivery agent availability, order placement time, estimated food preparation time, and estimated order dispatch time are considered. The project utilizes data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

Overview
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation and detecting outliers using the Z-score method and Interquartile Range (IQR) method. EDA techniques are employed to analyze the relationships between variables and delivery duration. The Decision Tree algorithm is implemented to build a predictive model based on the dataset. Model evaluation is performed using cross-validation to assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Conclusion
This project successfully predicts the delivery time for food orders by applying the Decision Tree algorithm and considering various factors. By leveraging data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation techniques, accurate predictions are achieved. The project contributes to improving delivery services and optimizing the food delivery process.
